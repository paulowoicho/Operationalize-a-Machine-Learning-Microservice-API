## Overview

The objective of this project is to operationalize a Machine Learning Microservice API. 

Given a pre-trained, `sklearn` model that has been trained to predict housing prices in Boston according to several features, such as average rooms in a home and data about highway access, teacher-to-pupil ratios, and so on, This project operationalizes it so that it in a Python flask app so that it serves out predictions through API calls.

You can find the following files in this repository:
- `Makefile`: Defines a set of takes to be executed to install, lint, and test the project
- `app.py`: contains the code that makes predictions based on input
- `Dockerfile`: builds a docker container
- `*.sh`: utilty scripts to run the project on docker/kubernetes, make predictions,ud or upload images to Docker
